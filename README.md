3.Removed missing data or filled them in
4.Checked for empty cells and either deleted rows/columns with excessive blanks or filled them with appropriate default values.

6.Identified and removed duplicate rows, ensuring each show (show_id) appeared only once for accuracy.
7.Standardized text values
8.Cleaned and uniformed text data like “country,” “director,” and “type” to ensure consistency (e.g., corrected spelling differences, standardized case).
9.Converted dates to a consistent format
10.Unified all date fields (e.g., date_added) into the dd-mm-yyyy format to make sorting and analysis easier.
11.Renamed headers to clean, lowercase names
12.Renamed columns (e.g., “Show ID” → show_id) for clarity and uniformity, removing spaces and ensuring lowercase for easier handling.
13.Ensured each column had the correct data type (e.g., release_year as integer, date_added as date) for seamless analysis.
14.Froze the header row in Excel for better navigation and consistent view while scrolling.
